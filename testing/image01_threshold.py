#=========================== image01_threshold ===========================
#
# @brief    Code to test out the simple image detector for a fairly
#           contrived scenario: threshold a grayscale image.
#
# Uses the base inImage class to do the work.  It was originally a
# blank base class that did nothing, but got redefined to have some
# minimal operational ability for simple cases. Also to help with rapid
# prototyping of more complex systems by providing a basic interface to
# build up from.

#==[0] Prep the environment.




#==[1] Perform the test process.

#--[1] Create a simple image that can be thresholded. Define threshold



#--[2] Instantiate inImage detector with a image processor that does
#      the thresholding.




#--[3] Apply and visualize.
