# detection
Collection of detection methods. Mostly code translated over from Matlab.

Some of it is image processing type of code for which there might be OpenCV implementations. In that case, they might be encapsulated by classes here that create a more generic interface. In some cases, the code will be rewritten for ease of translating the Matlab code. It really depends on what the needs are.
